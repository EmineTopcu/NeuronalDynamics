## The constant values used by Wang and colleague

V1 <- -0.01   # the constant used in steady state calculations
V2 <- 0.15    # the constant used in steady state calculations
V3 <- 0.1     # the constant used in steady state calculations
V4 <- 0.05    # the constant used in steady state calculations
EL <- 0.5     # Reversal potential of leakage
EK <- -0.7    # Reversal potential of K ions
ECa <- 1      # Reversal potential of Ca ions
lambda <- 30  # lambda: neurotransmitter release rate
gK <- 2       # maximum conductance of K channels
gL <- 0.5     # maximum conductance of leakage
gCa <- 1.2    # maximum conductance of Ca channels
mu <- 0.001   # feedback coefficient
thetas <- 0.1 # syanptic threshold
Vsyn <- 0.4   # autapse reversal potential
gamma_mult <- 1/3 # the multiplier used in gamma(V) calculation
Cm <- 1       # membrane conductance 
              # this value is not used in the original article
              # it is introduced as 1 to handle the runs with biological values
